        <h1>REQUIEM </h1>
            <p> Over the course of Spring-Summer 2025, I worked on self-producing a magazine titled "REQUIEM". The magazine contains 10 graphic design spreads, 9 of which by me and 1 by graphic designer & friend Gabi Linke. I couldn't thank my friends enoufh for being part of this project and I hope it resonates with you all as well!  </p>
